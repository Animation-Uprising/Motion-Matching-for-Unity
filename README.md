# Motion-Mathcing-for-Unity is now Free
As I have decided to leave the game industry entirely I am making MxM free. Unfortuantely, as a result, no support can be provided and I will likely not be updating the package further. Please consult the documentation as needed.

NOTE: This repository only contains the source code for 'Motion Matching for Unity'. It does not contain any content (including code) from the Demo that accompanies the asset.
